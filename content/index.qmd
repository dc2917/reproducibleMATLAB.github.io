This is a resource for learning and teaching about developing reproducible and sustainable code in the MATLAB programming language.

Here you will find content, exercises and videos intended to either be followed alone or with a group, or taught as part of a workshop.

The materials are primarily aimed at researchers and their specific demands, but are applicable to all uses of MATLAB.
