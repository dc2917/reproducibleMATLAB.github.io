# Writing cleaner code

Whilst this is primarily a guide to writing more *reproducible* MATLAB, I would argue that writing *cleaner* code is an important step. It can make your code easier to read and follow (for you as well as others) - making it simpler to spot errors and mistakes, as well as for others to make contributions and improve or build upon your code.
