# Reproducibility

## Introduction

In our practical exercises, we're going to be exploring, plotting and analysing some data from The University of Dayton - Environmental Protection Agency Average Daily Temperature Archive [@DaytonTempDataset] which contains daily average temperatures for cities around the world.

## Download the data
Firstly, we're going to need to download some data to work with.

The dataset we're using is freely available for non-commercial use.

Remember, that we should document how to get hold of the data or, even better, provide code to download it along with our codebase.
